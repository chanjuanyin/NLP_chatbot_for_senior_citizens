- - What is a computer?
  - A computer is now in all kinds of form. Your phone, smart TV, even the cleaner robot are forms of computers. They take digital information and perform operations based on instructions to give outputs.
- - What is a computer?
  - Computers take instructions and perform actions based on information they collected.
- - What is a super computer?
  - Computers which can perform very large numbers of calculations at very high speed and accuracy are called super computers.
- - What is a super computer?
  - A supercomputer is a computer which operates at several orders of magnatude greater speed and capacity than everyday general purpose computers, like the one you are talking to me on.
- - Who invented computers?
  - British scientist Charles Babbage is regarded as the father of computers.
- - Who invented computers?
  - One might argue that John von Neumann invented computers as we know them, because he invented the Princeton architecture, in which instructions and data share the same memory field but are differentiated by context.
- - What was the first computer
  - The ENIAC is regarded as the first 'real' computer. It was developed at University of Pennsylvania in 1946.
- - What was the first computer
  - You could say that the very first, primitive computer was the Jacquard Loom, which was a programmable loom that used punchcards to store the patterns it made.  This made it a reprogrammable mechanical device.
- - What is a microprocessor?
  - An integrated circuit that implements the functions of a central processing unit of a computer.
- - What is a microprocessor?
  - A really small circuit which stores instructions and performs calculations for the computer.
- - What is a microprocessor?
  - The heart of the computer, to put it simply.
- - What is a microprocessor?
  - The brain of a computer, to put it simply.
- - What is a microprocessor?
  - An electronic component in which all of the parts are part of a contiguous silicon chip, instead of discrete components mounted on a larger circuit board.
- - What is an operating system?
  - Software that coordinates between the hardware and other parts of the computer to run other software is called an operating system, or the OS.
- - What is an operating system?
  - Windows, MacOS, Linux, UNIX... all of them are types of OSes.
- - What is an operating system?
  - Android and iOS are operating systems for mobile devices.
- - What is an operating system?
  - Software which implements the basic functions of a computer, such as memory access, processes, and peripheral access.
- - Which is better Windows or macOS?
  - It depends on your preference. There is no official best answer, so just have a go on both systems to see which one fits you most.
- - Name some computer company
  - Apple, Microsoft, Deil, HP, Huawei, etc. 
- - Who uses super computers?
  - Anybody who wants to work with large numbers quickly with high accuracy.
- - Who uses super computers?
  - Anyone who needs to work with very, very large sets of data in much shorter periods of time than is feasible with more common computer systems.
- - How does a computer work?
  - Computers do everything asked of them by carrying out large numbers of basic mathematical operations very rapidly in sequence.
- - How does a computer work?
  - You input some instructions, the computer will help you execute those.
